Questions:

a) Look at the profiler output for vanilla_imageRescale(). Identify the
   lines that you think are un-necessary bottlenecks (i.e. lines whose
   CPU usage can be reduced or eliminated by careful coding).

   List these bottleneck lines in descending order (i.e. the ones that
   consume most time at the top) of CPU time. Please list
	- The actual line of code
	- The amount of time taken
	(you can copy/paste from the profiler output)

   For each line, explain why the line creates a bottleneck (in terms
   of what you know about CPU architecture). I want specific reasons
   why a line you listed takes a large chunk of CPU time.

b) For each of the lines in a)

   Describe what you did in fast_imageRescale() to reduce/resolve the
   problem.

   Explain why your improvement should work (again, based on what you
   know about CPU architecture).


c) Is there any part of the vanilla code that could not be optimized
   at all? if so, which?

d) Do you think you have achieved close to optimal performance on this
   code? (yes/no)

e) If your answer to d) is no, what could you do to further increase
   performance?
